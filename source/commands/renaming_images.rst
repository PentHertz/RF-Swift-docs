Renaming Images
===============

You can rename images using the ``rename`` command as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

	rfswift rename -i myrfswift:supertag -t myrfswift:newsupertag

.. tips::

   When renaming your image to ``myrfswift:latest`` you do not need to use images arguments to precise the image you want to use for most commands.
